- [x] bloom filter (used to optimize search non-exist key)
- [x] range get
- [x] optimize set
- [ ] tx, mvcc
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] restrict sstable size (maybe need a goroutine to check size, then divide or merge)
- [ ] target size (all non-0 levels have target sizes. Compaction's goal will be to restrict data size of those levels to be under the target. The size targets are usually exponentially increasing) [ref](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Leveled-Compaction)
